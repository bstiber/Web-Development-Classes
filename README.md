# Web-Development-Classes
Started taking online classes and tutorials on March 17th.
A little about me.  I have always been interested in computers but felt that since I did not have a bachelors degree in computer science that it was not a good idea to pursue a career in computing nor was I qualified to study computers.  Boy was I wrong.  Better late than never, "I say".  Here I am now studying online Web Development.  I am following the Odin-Project web development full stack, as well as taking other courses that deviate from the Odin-Project outline, utlizing Udacity, Udemy, codeacademy, just to name a few.
